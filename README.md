## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I will  convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.<br />
  **First Step:** I converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays<br />
  **Second Step:** accessible for screen reader use.<br />
  **Third Step:** add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.<br />
  #### I used Mapbox
